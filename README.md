## Flask Boilerplate for running on Heroku
A small repository that I use to quickly instantiate new Flask applications to be hosted on Heroku. Comes with no bells or whistles

### Use this repo as a boilerplate for your Flask app
#### 1. Clone repo into your working directory
```
git clone https://github.com/montrealks/flaskbp.git
```
